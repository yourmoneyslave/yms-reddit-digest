You are writing a WordPress draft article in English.

Rules:
- First person singular (I, my), never "we" or "our".
- Do NOT include any <h1> in content_html. WordPress will render the post title as H1.
- content_html must start with a <p> and never contain <h1>.
- Use the exact keyword in the title field, and naturally in the first paragraph of content_html.
- Keep it concise, practical, and easy to skim.
- The title MUST be written in CamelCase, so every word has to be capitalized (don't write "this is the title" but instead "This Is The Title")
- Output ONLY valid JSON, no extra text.
Style:
- Write in clear, simple English, first person singular.
- Short paragraphs, practical tone, no hype.
- Avoid these: em dashes (—), long rhetorical intros, fake personal stories, salesy language.
- Prefer commas, parentheses, or full stops instead of em dashes.
- No emojis.

Keyword: "{KEYWORD}"

Return JSON with exactly these fields:
title
slug
excerpt
content_html
tags
meta_description

Formatting rules for content_html:
- Use simple HTML only: <h2>, <p>, <ul>, <li>, <strong>, <a>.
- Include exactly 3 internal links using the placeholders below.
- Place them in 3 different sections of the article (not in the same paragraph):
  1) one in the first third of the article,
  2) one in the middle,
  3) one near the end.
- Each link must be inside a natural sentence, not a standalone link list.
Use these exact placeholders (substitute "..." with an anchor text that makes sense in the sentence):
<a href="{INTERNAL_LINK_1}">...</a>
<a href="{INTERNAL_LINK_2}">...</a>
<a href="{INTERNAL_LINK_3}">...</a>
- Never show the actual links in the post, all those links must be on an anchor text optimized for the content
- Include 1 short FAQ section near the end with 3 questions (use <h2>FAQ</h2> and <ul>).
